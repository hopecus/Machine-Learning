## Python for Stand-alone Application
I would like to make GUI application with many powerful Python packages.
Windows Presentation Foundation(WPF) application use XAML files to describe rich user interfaces, and Visual Studio inclues a drag and drop designer for WPF windows. With IronPython, the code behind the GUI can be written with Python.

* Python Tools for Visual Studio : https://github.com/Microsoft/PTVS

* IronPython : http://ironpython.net/

* IronPyCompiler : http://pythonhosted.org/ironpycompiler/html-en/index.html
 
: IronPyCompiler is library for compiling IronPython scripts requiring modules from the python standard library into stand-alone .Net DLL lib. or executable application using pyc.py
